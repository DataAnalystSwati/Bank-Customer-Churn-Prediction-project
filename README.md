#Machine Learning Model for Customer Churn Prediction

#Overview
This repository contains code for a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the company in the near future so that proactive measures can be taken to retain them.

#Problem Type
This is a supervised learning problem.

Supervised Learning: Supervised learning involves labeled data where the algorithm learns from both input and output data.

#Classification: Classification is used when the output variable is a category.

#Models Used
The following models were used to tackle the problem:

Random Forest Classifier: A popular ensemble learning method for classification tasks.
Logistic Regression: A simple linear model used for binary classification problems.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective for both linear and nonlinear classification tasks.
Decision Tree Classifier: A simple and interpretable model for classification tasks.
Code

#The code provided in this repository includes:

Data preprocessing: The data is cleaned and prepared for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model training: The models mentioned above are trained using the training data.
Model evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model comparison: The performance of different models is compared to identify the best-performing model for the problem.
Usage

#To use the code in this repository:

Run the Python scripts provided in the repository to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about customers such as their demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

#Results
The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 85% on the test data, making it the best-performing model for predicting customer churn in this dataset.
